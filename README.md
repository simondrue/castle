# Welcome to the CASTLE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Using the right analysis tool for your ddPCR analysis results when
detecting low frequency variants can mean night and day for the
performance. In this package functions for training a model and testing
samples for low frequency variants are provided, as well as
functionality to handle output .csv-files generated by QuantaSoft from
Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.  This package is a user friendly
implementation of the CASTLE algorithm, as it is described in \[1\].

\[1\]: \[article\].

## Installation

You can install the R -package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simondrue/castle")
```

## Quickstart guide

In this section we will go through a typical analysis workflow using the
`castle` package:

1.  How to load a set of droplet counts from a QuantaSoft dataset. For
    this the data needs to be in `.csv`-format.
2.  Training an model for the CASTLE algorithm. This is done by
    analyzing the (assay) specific pattern of errors in a set of
    negative (background) samples.
3.  Analyze some samples of interest for the presence of a mutation, by
    utilizing the CASTLE algorithm with the model trained above.

The first thing we need to do is load the packages we need for the
analysis:

``` r
library(castle)
#> Loading required package: readr
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

### Loading QuantaSoft data

We start by loading a QuantaSoft dataset in `.csv`-format using the
included `import_QS_files`-function. Here we will use the example data
included in the package, where we have both negative samples of
different concentrations (training samples) and some test samples
available for a KRAS G12D assay. For this assay Ch1 was used for
measuring the mutant signal, which is set using the flag
`Ch1_is_mutation = TRUE`. If Ch2 was used this is simply set to `FALSE`.
Data is loaded like this:

``` r
path_to_my_data <- c("path/to/a/csv_file", "path/to/a/folder/with/csv_files/")
my_samples <- import_QS_files(path_to_my_data)
```

For this example we will load the training samples that are bundled in
the `castle`-package:

``` r
path_to_my_data <- system.file("extdata/example_data/", "background_data_KRAS_G12D.csv", package = "castle")
background_samples <- import_QS_files(path_to_my_data, Ch1_is_mutation = TRUE)
```

The first 5 samples/wells in `background_samples` looks like this:

``` r
head(background_samples, 5)
```

| FileName                         | Sample    | Well | Ch1TargetType | Ch2TargetType | Target            | DoubleNegativeDroplets | WildtypeOnlyDroplets | MutantOnlyDroplets | DoublePositiveDroplets | TotalDroplets | NumberOfMergedWells | MergedWells |

| background\_data\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | NC24\_150 | E01  | Unknown       | Unknown       | KRAS\_G12D\_(FAM) |                   1487 |                 9421 |                  0 |                      0 |         10908 |                   1 | NA          |

Note that besides some metadata (file name, target etc.) for each
sample, the dataset contains the columns “WildtypeOnlyDroplets”,
“MutantOnlyDroplets”, “DoubleNegativeDroplets” and
“DoublePositiveDroplets”. These are the counts of the four different
kinds of droplets for each sample based on the two signals in Ch1 and
Ch2. The following model training and statistical tests are based solely
on these counts.

### Training a model for CASTLE

To train the model we are only interested in the negative samples.
Ideally these should cover the range of different concentrations of DNA
that the trained model is expected to encounter in future test samples.
Before training we start by removing the empty samples (“NTC”) and
positive controls from the training dataset we loaded above:

``` r
# Remove control samples ("NTC" and "Positive Control")
clean_background_samples <-
  background_samples %>%
  filter(
    !(Ch1TargetType %in% c("NTC", "Positive Control")),
    !(Ch2TargetType %in% c("NTC", "Positive Control"))
  )
```

The cleaned data is then used for model training using the function
`train_simple_ddpcr_model`:

``` r
trained_model <- train_integrated_ddpcr_model(
  background_samples = clean_background_samples
)
```

The object `trained_model` is simply a list of parameters used in the
statistical model in CASTLE.

### Testing some samples with CASTLE

For testing we will use a variety of samples from two different
patients, who have undergone curative surgery for colorectal cancer. We
start by loading the data from these patients. To load the data we will
again use the function `import_QS_files`. But this time, data from some
of the samples is distributed across multiple wells. These can be merged
together using the flag `merge_wells = 'yes'` (see `?import_QS_files`
for other methods for merging). Furthermore samples across multiple
files can also be merged using the flag `merge_files = TRUE` if
necessary.

``` r
# Path to example data in the package
path_to_my_test_samples <- system.file(
  "extdata/example_data/test_samples",
  c(
    "patient_1_plasma_KRAS_G12D.csv",
    "patient_2_plasma_KRAS_G12D.csv"
  ),
  package = "castle"
)

# Import test examples
test_samples <-
  import_QS_files(
    path_to_my_test_samples,
    merge_wells = "yes"
  )
```

To test the samples we use the function `test_tumor_sample_integrated`
and use the model we trained above:

``` r
# Make calls using CASTLE
test_res <- test_tumor_sample_integrated(
  test_samples = test_samples,
  integrated_model = trained_model
)
```

We will start by looking at some of the results for the tumor and PBL
(white blood cells) sample from each patient:

``` r
test_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Sample %in% c("Tumor", "PBL")) %>%
  dplyr::select(FileName, Sample, p_val, mutation_detected)
```

| FileName                           | Sample |    p\_val | mutation\_detected |
|:-----------------------------------|:-------|----------:|:-------------------|
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Tumor  | 0.0000000 | TRUE               |
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | PBL    | 1.0000000 | FALSE              |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Tumor  | 0.0000000 | TRUE               |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | PBL    | 0.4550231 | FALSE              |

From this, we clearly see that the mutation is present in the tumor from
both of the patients and not in PBL. We can therefore use the mutation
as a cancer-specific marker, and thus to check if the patient has
residual disease after curative intent surgery. As a positive test, we
start by looking at the “Plasma\_A” sample of both patients, which is a
blood sample collected before surgery:

``` r
test_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Sample %in% c("Plasma_A")) %>%
  dplyr::select(FileName, Sample, p_val, mutation_detected)
```

| FileName                           | Sample    | p\_val | mutation\_detected |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------|-------:|:-------------------|
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |      0 | TRUE               |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |      0 | TRUE               |

We see that these samples indicate that the mutation, and thus the
tumor, is present in both patients, as expected. From the result we can
also see the following estimates of properties of the ddPCR analysis and
the ctDNA in the blood:

``` r
test_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Sample %in% c("Plasma_A")) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    FileName, Sample,
    mutant_molecules_per_droplet,
    wildtype_molecules_per_droplet,
    total_mutant_molecules,
    mutant_molecules_per_droplet_CI_lower, mutant_molecules_per_droplet_CI_upper,
    wildtype_molecules_per_droplet_CI_lower, wildtype_molecules_per_droplet_CI_upper
  )
```

| FileName                           | Sample    | mutant\_molecules\_per\_droplet | wildtype\_molecules\_per\_droplet | total\_mutant\_molecules | mutant\_molecules\_per\_droplet\_CI\_lower | mutant\_molecules\_per\_droplet\_CI\_upper | wildtype\_molecules\_per\_droplet\_CI\_lower | wildtype\_molecules\_per\_droplet\_CI\_upper |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------|--------------------------------:|----------------------------------:|-------------------------:|-------------------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------:|
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |                       0.0002420 |                         0.2235039 |                 21.32192 |                                  0.0001289 |                                  0.0004051 |                                    0.2191840 |                                    0.2278834 |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |                       0.0038629 |                         0.0959883 |                376.09432 |                                  0.0033714 |                                  0.0043999 |                                    0.0933878 |                                    0.0986397 |

``` r
test_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Sample %in% c("Plasma_A")) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    FileName, Sample,
    allele_frequency,
    allele_frequency_CI_lower, allele_frequency_CI_upper
  )
```

| FileName                           | Sample    | allele\_frequency | allele\_frequency\_CI\_lower | allele\_frequency\_CI\_upper |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------|------------------:|-----------------------------:|-----------------------------:|
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |         0.0010815 |                    0.0005764 |                    0.0018094 |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_A |         0.0386864 |                    0.0339311 |                    0.0438292 |

We can then look what happens after the surgery. To do this we look at
the blood samples marked as “Plasma\_B”:

``` r
test_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Sample %in% c("Plasma_B")) %>%
  dplyr::select(FileName, Sample, p_val, mutation_detected)
```

| FileName                           | Sample    |    p\_val | mutation\_detected |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------|----------:|:-------------------|
| patient\_1\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_B | 0.3061083 | FALSE              |
| patient\_2\_plasma\_KRAS\_G12D.csv | Plasma\_B | 0.2424636 | FALSE              |

The full list of information available in the analysis results is:

    #> [28] "wildtype_molecules_per_droplet_CI_lower"
    #> [29] "wildtype_molecules_per_droplet_CI_upper"

We now see that the test indicates that the mutation is no longer
present in any of the patients, which is consistent with the tumor being
removed by surgery.

## Note

Alternatively the functions `train_integrated_ddpcr_model` and
`test_tumor_sample_simple` are used for training and testing
respectively. These are based on a faster (and simpler) version of the
CASTLE algorithm, but have very similar performance. See \[1\] for more
information.

## Simulating data

In the package the function `simulate_droplet_counts` for simulating
droplet counts from the statistical model that CASTLE is based on is
also provided. Here we will simulate a positive and negative sample
based on the parameters learned above, and test them using
`test_tumor_sample_integrated`:

``` r
# DNA concentration (molecules per droplet)
l <- 0.5 # WT
r_positive <- 0.01 # M
r_negative <- 0 # M

# Number of droplets
n_drops <- 14000

# Positive sample
test_sample_positive <-
  simulate_droplet_counts(
    l = l, r = r_positive,
    a = trained_model$a_est, b = trained_model$b_est, c = trained_model$c_est,
    n_drops = n_drops
  )

# Negative sample
test_sample_negative <-
  simulate_droplet_counts(
    l = l, r = r_negative,
    a = trained_model$a_est, b = trained_model$b_est, c = trained_model$c_est,
    n_drops = n_drops
  )


simulated_samples <- bind_rows(
  data.frame(Sample = "Positive", test_sample_positive),
  data.frame(Sample = "Negative", test_sample_negative)
)


# Test samples
sim_test_res <- test_tumor_sample_simple(
  test_samples = simulated_samples,
  simple_model = trained_model
)

# Print some relevant results
sim_test_res %>% select(
  Sample, p_val, mutation_detected,
  total_mutant_molecules, total_mutant_molecules_CI_lower, total_mutant_molecules_CI_upper
)
```

| Sample   | p\_val | mutation\_detected | total\_mutant\_molecules | total\_mutant\_molecules\_CI\_lower | total\_mutant\_molecules\_CI\_upper |
|:---------|-------:|:-------------------|-------------------------:|------------------------------------:|------------------------------------:|
| Positive |      0 | TRUE               |                 143.2925 |                            114.5137 |                          176.515145 |
| Negative |      1 | FALSE              |                   0.0000 |                              0.0000 |                            3.317448 |
