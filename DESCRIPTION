Description: This package is a user friendly implementation of the CASTLE (**C**oncentration and **A**ssay **S**pecific **T**umor **L**oad **E**stimator) algorithm, as it is described in [1]. Using the right analysis tool for your ddPCR analysis results when detecting low frequency variants can mean night and day for the performance of your pipeline. In this package functions for training a model and testing samples for low frequency variants are provided, as well as functionality to handle output .csv-files generated by QuantaSoft from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.
