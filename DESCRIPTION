Description: Using the right analysis tool for your ddPCR analysis results when detecting low frequency variants can mean night and day for the performance. 
    In this package functions for training a model and testing samples for low frequency variants are provided, and includes functionality to handle output files generated by QuantaSoft from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. 
    This package is a user friendly implementation of the CASTLE algorithm, as it is described in [1].
